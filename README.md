# Moodle Block Components Repository
Welcome to our Moodle Block Components Repository! This is a hub for various block components specifically designed to enhance the Moodle user experience.

Our goal is to foster an open-source community where everyone can contribute and benefit. This repository hosts a growing collection of Moodle block components, each aiming to add unique features and utilities to Moodle, such as presenting courses in a Moodle Block.

# How to Implement Moodle Block Components
Follow these steps to implement a Moodle Block Component:

1. Navigate to your Moodle Dashboard.
2. In the top right corner of your dashboard, click to enable 'Edit Mode'.
3. Click 'Add a block'. This option should appear on the side of your dashboard. You can select any type of block at this stage.
4. After creating the block, find the 'Settings' option for this block. It's usually represented by a gear icon.
5. In the settings, you will see pre-populated HTML, CSS, and JS code. Clear out all this code to make room for your new Moodle Block Component.
6. Look for an arrow or a drop-down option in the HTML block section, click on it.
7. Find and click on the brackets </>. This option allows you to input HTML code directly.
8. Paste the HTML code from your chosen Moodle Block Component. The required HTML code can be found in the corresponding Block file in this repository.
9. Save your changes and close the settings panel.
10. Observe your Moodle Dashboard. The new block component should now be visible and functional.

Remember, the implementation might slightly vary based on the version of Moodle you're using or custom themes that are in place. If you encounter any problems or need further clarification, don't hesitate to raise an issue. Enjoy your new Moodle experience!

Please carefully follow the above instructions to properly implement these components into your Moodle front-end. If you encounter any problems or need further clarification, feel free to raise an issue.
